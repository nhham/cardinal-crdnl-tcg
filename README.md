# Cardinal CRDNL TCG
### The "Bloomberg Terminal" for Trading Card Liquidity

> **Status:** In Development (Private Beta)  
> **Type:** Market Intelligence Tool

## 🚀 About the Project
Cardinal CRDNL is a high velocity market analytics engine designed to solve the problem of **"Liquidity"** (how fast a card sells) rather than just **"Value"** (what a card is worth). For now, it will be a website and hopefully will expand to mobile devices.

Unlike standard portfolio trackers that act as a "rear-view mirror," Cardinal CRDNL functions as a "windshield" for investors, utilizing a proprietary **Universal Adapter** to aggregate data from Pokémon, Magic: The Gathering, and Sports markets.

## 🛠 Core Capabilities
* **Liquidity Velocity Scoring:** A weighted algorithmic score (0-100) analyzing "churn rate" (Active Listings vs. Sold Listings) to predict time-to-sale.
* **Arbitrage Detection:** Real-time identification of price discrepancies between major marketplaces.
* **Supply Crunch Alerts:** Predictive modeling that flags inventory drops before price spikes occur.

## 🤝 Compliance & Ecosystem
We are building a compliance-first ecosystem. Cardinal CRDNL is designed to operate strictly within the Terms of Service of our data partners:
* **Data Sources:** Official API integrations (eBay Developers Program, Scryfall, PokemonTCG.io).
* **Affiliate Integration:** Native support for TCGPlayer affiliate linking to drive high-intent traffic to marketplace listings.
